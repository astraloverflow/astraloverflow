<!--### Hi there ðŸ‘‹-->

### Hi, I'm Samuel Champagne

I'm a Frontend Web Developer and CSS Enthusiast. I've made some stuff, like [FirstStrike.css](https://firststrike.dev/), a lightweight & modern alternative to normalize.css, as well as [Frameworkless.dev](https://frameworkless.dev/), an intuitive doc site that helps developers rely less on heavy frameworks & libraries. I also sometimes write on my [blog](https://samuelchampagne.com/blog/).
